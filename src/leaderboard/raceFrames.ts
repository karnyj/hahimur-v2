// each knockout fixture's advancer at that very fixture — so a team's deep-run
// bonus never leaks into earlier frames. (The previous resultsAsOf snapshot kept
// the full knockout bracket revealed in every frame, so computeUserPoints handed
// out R32→SF advancement during the group stage, telling a false early story.)
